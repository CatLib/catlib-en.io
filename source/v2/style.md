# Code style

This is CatLib's unique code style guide. If you use CatLib in your project, to avoid errors, reduce communication costs, small tangles and [anti-patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern ), reading this guide is a good choice.

We can't guarantee that everything in the style guide is ideal for all projects and teams, so depending on the project environment, the surrounding technical environment, style deviations are feasible.

We should follow the recommendations of this style guide as much as possible.

According to the surrounding technology stack for naming conventions, we recommend that you read what Microsoft provides: [Framework Design Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/index)


## Priority definition

#### (A)Must

These rule will help you avoid mistakes, and you must adhere to them. There can be exceptions here, but it should be very rare, and exceptions can be made only if you are very familiar with c# and the surrounding technology stack and have good reasons.

#### (B)Highly suggest

These rule improve readability and program elegance in most projects. Even if you violate it, the code will still work as usual, there may be exceptions, but the exceptions should be as small as possible and for good reason.

#### (C)Suggest

In these rules, we make a default suggestion, and if the reasons are sufficient, you can make different choices in your code base.

#### (D)Not suggest

These rules can make the code difficult to maintain and even bugs. These rules list the potential technical risks that exist and explain when they should not be used.
